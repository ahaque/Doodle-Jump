## How to Run

In shell, go to this repository folder and type:

```shell
javac GameShell.java
appletviewer Launch.html
```

If `javac` or `appletviewer` isn't found, the problem is caused by forgetting to set the environment variables.

For example, in Windows platform, you should append something like `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_144\bin` to your `PATH` environment variable.
